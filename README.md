# The Little Schemer
![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-27986795-3/little_scheme/readme?pixel)
The repo contains my working code examples of [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992).

The book is presented in a dialog between you and author and guides you to think recursively hand by hand.

# Run
The code is written to be run in [ChezScheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme). A common workflow is using [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) in Emacs.

In case there are errors of no connection, seeking out for issues such as:
- https://github.com/jaor/geiser/issues/200
- https://github.com/jaor/geiser/issues/185
